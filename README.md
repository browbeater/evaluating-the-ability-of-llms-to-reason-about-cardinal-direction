# Evaluating the Ability of Large Language Models to Reason about Cardinal Directions

This repository is an online appendix and companion to our
[COSIT 2024](https://cosit.ca/) short paper submission.

The `data` subdirectory contains the questions, answers, prompts and
LLM responses for our _small_ and _large_ experiments. Files are in
[JSONL](https://jsonlines.org/) format.

Supplementary analyses will follow shortly.
